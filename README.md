Air Cargo Supply Chain Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview:
This project focuses on applying machine learning models to predict and optimize various aspects of the air cargo supply chain. By leveraging historical data, predictive models are built to forecast demand, optimize cargo distribution, and enhance the overall efficiency of the supply chain. This approach aims to reduce operational costs, improve delivery times, and increase customer satisfaction.

Key Objectives
Demand Prediction: Predict cargo demand across different routes and time periods.

Optimization: Enhance operational efficiency in cargo distribution and resource allocation.

Cost Reduction: Minimize supply chain costs by improving decision-making with data-driven insights.

Real-time Decision Making: Automate and streamline supply chain processes with predictions based on historical data.

Data Overview
The data for this project is provided through an Excel file that contains detailed records of various air cargo shipments, including the following features:

Shipment Date: The date when the shipment was made.

Airline: The carrier handling the shipment.

Cargo Weight: The weight of the cargo being transported.

Cargo Type: Type of goods being shipped (e.g., perishables, electronics, etc.).

Origin/Destination: Departure and arrival locations for the shipment.

Flight Duration: Duration of the flight for the specific cargo.

Demand Volume: The total number of shipments or volume of cargo transported.

Airports Performance: Data on how well specific airports handle cargo and throughput.

File Details:
File Name: air_cargo_supplychain.xlsx

Description: This file contains historical shipment records used to train and test the machine learning model.

How the System Works
Data Preprocessing:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting categorical variables into numerical representations.

Feature Engineering: Creating meaningful features (e.g., flight delays, seasonal demand trends) to improve the model's accuracy.

Model Selection:

Various machine learning models are used, including:

Regression Models for predicting continuous variables such as cargo demand and shipment costs.

Classification Models to categorize cargo types or predict whether cargo will meet specific deadlines.

Training the Model:

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

Cross-validation is used to ensure that the model generalizes well to new, unseen data.

Model Evaluation:

The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error (MSE) for regression tasks.

Machine Learning Models Used
Random Forest:

A versatile ensemble learning model that works well for both classification and regression tasks.

It reduces the risk of overfitting by combining multiple decision trees.

Logistic Regression:

Used for binary or multiclass classification tasks, such as predicting whether a shipment will arrive on time or not.

XGBoost:

An advanced version of gradient boosting, providing high performance for classification and regression tasks.

It helps in dealing with non-linearity in the data and is known for its speed and accuracy.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):

A simple yet effective model used for classification tasks based on distance metrics.

Often used to predict cargo demand patterns based on historical data.

Usage Instructions
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
To run this project, you will need the following Python libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Prepare Data
Ensure that the data in air_cargo_supplychain.xlsx is loaded and cleaned before training the model.

python
Copy
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_excel('path_to_file/air_cargo_supplychain.xlsx')

# Preprocess data (e.g., handle missing values, feature engineering)
Step 3: Train the Model
Train the model using the preprocessed data:

python
Copy
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Initialize and train the model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
Step 4: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model’s performance using appropriate metrics.

python
Copy
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
